	<p>Hello, wild creature from the internet! My name is Vítor Makoto from Brazil and I just graduated with a bachelor's degree in software engineering from the University of Brasília.</p>

	<p>Currently I've been working/studying in an program called BEPiD, which stands for Brazilian Education Program for iOS Development. A program that has the collaboration of Apple and Eldorado.</p>

	<p>Anyway, I'm here to mainly talk about one of my passions, which is game development. Because of my not so long background, you can expect a more programmer perspective out of my posts.</p>

	<p>Since I'm a tech nerd, you can also expect posts with some random contents, such as: iOS developement, AngularJS, Jekyll, Ruby on Rails and Unity.</p>

	<p>Oh!!! As you might have noticed, english is not my first language... Hopefully you will bear with me! ;)</p>
	
	<p>Well, without further ado, welcome to my little hut here on the internet!</p>
